# How the tool works

The tool is used to easily categorize mails into labels based on different options (sender, keyword, subject)
Using the Gmail API labels can be created and labels of messages can be modified. These API requests were implemented to create this project
When the user makes a request, the messages satisfying the condition are selected and their corresponding labels are modified.
Authentication was done using Google OAuth.

# How to configure and run

- Provide the API key and CLIENT ID in script.js file
